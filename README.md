# Taipei Tourist Map (Upgrade Pack)

This version matches your requirements:
- **Filtering + search** (restored)
- **Lots of tourist spots** with categories (Taipei + day trips: Jiufen, Shifen, Yehliu, Tamsui, Keelung, etc.)
- **NO MRT layer** (removed)
- **English basemap options** using free tile sources

## Deploy on GitHub Pages
Upload these files to repo root:
- index.html
- style.css
- app.js
- spots.js

Then Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → main /(root)

## Data sources for spot selection (for your reference)
Spots are compiled from common tourist lists including Taipei tourism official resources and Taiwan tourism portals.
(You can edit/extend in spots.js.)

Basemaps:
- CARTO (light/voyager): English labels in most places
- Esri World Street Map: English-ish
- OSM default: local labels
